      “Hooks solve a wide variety of seemingly unconnected problems in React that we’ve encountered over five years of writing and maintaining tens of thousands of components. Whether you’re learning React, use it daily, or even prefer a different library with a similar component model, you might recognize some of these problems.”

    <blockquote cite="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/04/react-hooks-api-guide/">
      “According to the ReactJS official documentation, the following are the motivation behind the release of React Hooks:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reusing stateful logic between components is difficult.</strong> With Hooks, you can reuse logic between your components without changing their architecture or structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Complex components can be difficult to understand.</strong> When components become larger and carry out many operations, it becomes difficult to understand in the long run. Hooks solve this by allowing you separate a particular single component into various smaller functions based upon what pieces of this separated component are related (such as setting up a subscription or fetching data), rather than having to force a split based on lifecycle methods.</li>
        <li><strong>Classes are quite confusing.</strong> Classes are a hindrance to learning React properly; you would need to understand how this in JavaScript works which differs from other languages. React Hooks solves this problem by allowing developers to use the best of React features without having to use classes."</li>
      </ul>
